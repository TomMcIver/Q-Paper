# **Q-Paper: My Quantum Computing Journey** 🧠⚛️  

This repository documents my **journey into quantum computing**, focusing on building my knowledge and coding skills in quantum mechanics. I will start with the **fundamentals**, such as **entanglement** and **superposition**, and progressively develop **more complex quantum circuits and algorithms**.

Along the way, I will explore **different types of entanglement**, including:  
✅ **Bell States** – Basic two-qubit entanglement.  
✅ **GHZ States** – Multi-qubit entanglement across multiple qubits.  
✅ **Cluster States** – Used in measurement-based quantum computing.  
✅ **Other advanced quantum states** to be added in the future.
